As 2025 draws to a close, Open Neuromorphic stands at a pivotal moment. Over the last year, we have formalized our governance, launched the **[Open Neuromorphic Research (ONR)](/neuromorphic-computing/research/)** program, and built a robust operational engine driven by dedicated volunteers.

In accordance with our [Organisational Charter]({{< ref "/about/governance/organisational-charter" >}}), we are pleased to announce our **2026 Annual General Meeting (GM)**. This meeting will set the strategic direction for the coming year and host the elections for the next Executive Committee.

## Event Details

*   **Date:** Tuesday, January 20th, 2026 (Tentative)
*   **Time:** 17:00 CET / 11:00 AM EST
*   **Location:** Virtual (Link will be provided to registered members)
*   **Agenda:**
  *   2025 Community Report & Financial Overview
  *   Ratification of the 2026 Strategic Roadmap
  *   **Election of Officers (Chair & Secretary)**

## The Vision for 2026: From Hub to Institution

In 2025, we focused on building infrastructure. We established the website as a knowledge graph, launched the Mission Board, and created the policies that govern our open-source collaboration.

In 2026, our goal is to evolve Open Neuromorphic from a community hub into a **Research Institution**. We aim to become a formal consortium that not only aggregates knowledge but actively shapes policy, standardizes infrastructure (like taxonomies and interoperability), and secures funding to support open-source maintainers.

To achieve this, we are opening nominations for two key leadership roles.

## Call for Nominations

We are seeking leaders who can bridge the gap between academic rigor, open-source development, and strategic growth.

**Important Note on Operational Continuity:**
To ensure stability during this transition, **Justin Riddiough will retain the seat of Vice-Chair** for the 2026 term. He will continue to manage the digital infrastructure, website, and automation pipelines. This ensures that incoming officers can focus on **strategy and community**, rather than technical operations.

### 1. The Chair
*The Strategic Architect*

We are looking for a Chair to guide ONM's transition into a formal consortium. This is a high-level strategic role, not an operational one. Day-to-day logistics (events, social media, discord moderation) are now handled by our capable [Volunteer Teams](/contributors/), allowing the Chair to focus on high-impact goals.

**Ideal Qualifications:**
*   **Academic & Scientific Credibility:** Ability to represent ONM to research labs, funding bodies (e.g., NSF, EU Grants), and industry partners.
*   **Open Source Pedigree:** A deep understanding of the software ecosystem (snnTorch, Brian, Norse, etc.) and the needs of maintainers.
*   **Strategic Vision:** An interest in defining standards, such as hardware/software taxonomies and policy frameworks.

### 2. The Secretary
*Director of Community*

The Secretary is the heartbeat of our governance. While the Charter defines this role as the keeper of records, we view the 2026 Secretary as the **Director of Community**.

**Ideal Qualifications:**
*   **Communication Skills:** Passionate about connecting people and fostering an inclusive environment.
*   **Organizational Insight:** Managing the membership roll, coordinating with volunteer leads, and ensuring our governance remains transparent and accessible.

## How to Nominate

Per our Charter, any active member of the Open Neuromorphic community may nominate themselves or another member for office.

1.  **Check Eligibility:** You must be an active member of the community.
2.  **Submit Nomination:** Please add your nomination to the **[2026 Candidates Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KOqMB0fnD3AoEALp3CrUygVpTP7SuX2Ekhwa0O5aUpI/edit?gid=0#gid=0)**.
3.  **Deadline:** Nominations close on **January 15th, 2026**.

## Voting Process

Voting will take place during the General Meeting. If you cannot attend, please contact the current Secretary to arrange a proxy vote or asynchronous ballot as permitted by the Charter.

We look forward to seeing you there and building the future of Open Neuromorphic together.
