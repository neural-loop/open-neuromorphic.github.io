summary: Speck is a fully event-driven neuromorphic vision SoC. Speck is able to support large-scale spiking convolutional neural network (sCNN) with a fully asynchronous chip architecture. Speck is fully configurable with the spiking neuron capacity of 328K. Furthermore, it integrates the state-of-art dynamic vision sensor (DVS) that enables fully event-driven based, real-time, highly integrated solution for varies dynamic visual scene. For classical applications, Speck can provide intelligence upon the scene at only mWs with a latency of 3.36us for a single event processed by a 9 layer network.
