Hacking Hours are live, interactive coding sessions dedicated to exploring the world of neuromorphic software.
Hosted by Jens E. Pedersen, these sessions often feature guest developers from the community and industry
to provide deep dives into specific neuromorphic frameworks, tools, and problem-solving techniques.

Join us to:
- See live coding and debugging.
- Learn about new software and best practices.
- Ask questions and interact with experts.
- Collaborate on challenges.

Sessions are typically streamed and recorded for later viewing.
Check the [Hacking Hours page](/neuromorphic-computing/software/hacking-hours/) for the schedule and past episodes.
