The "Website Development & Maintenance" initiative, spearheaded by Justin Riddiough, is dedicated to the ongoing enhancement and upkeep of the official Open Neuromorphic website ([open-neuromorphic.org](https://open-neuromorphic.org)).

The core goals of this initiative include:

*   **Central Hub:** Ensuring the website serves as a comprehensive and accessible central repository for ONM resources, news, event information, and community updates.
*   **Content Management:** Regularly updating content to reflect the latest activities, research, and developments within the neuromorphic field and the ONM community.
*   **Feature Enhancements:** Implementing new features and functionalities to improve user experience and engagement.
*   **Technical Maintenance:** Overseeing the technical aspects of the website, including performance optimization, security, and bug fixes.

This initiative is crucial for maintaining a vibrant and informative online presence for Open Neuromorphic.
