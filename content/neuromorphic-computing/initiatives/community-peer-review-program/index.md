## Objective
This initiative aims to establish a formal peer review program to leverage community expertise and promote high-quality open-source neuromorphic projects. By providing authors with valuable feedback and an ONM "stamp of approval," we can increase the visibility, credibility, and reliability of projects within the neuromorphic ecosystem.

## Key Outcomes
- Launch of the ONM Community Peer Review Program with clear public criteria.
- At least one project successfully reviewed and awarded the ONM badge.
- Publication of review summaries on the ONM blog to showcase community-vetted work.
