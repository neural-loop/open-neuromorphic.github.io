## Objective
As ONM initiatives scale, we need to move away from inconsistent approaches to task management. This initiative will establish standardized, repeatable methods for executing tasks across the community. By creating reusable workflows and documentation standards (SOPs), we can help contributors complete tasks more confidently and improve the organizationâ€™s overall reliability and efficiency.

## Key Outcomes
- A curated list of common ONM task types (e.g., event setup, initiative launch).
- Standard operating procedures (SOPs) and checklist templates for key tasks.
- Public documentation of these repeatable workflows.
