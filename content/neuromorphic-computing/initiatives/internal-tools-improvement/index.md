## Objective
This initiative focuses on enhancing ONMâ€™s internal infrastructure to support leadership and contributor efficiency. By auditing our current toolset (Discord, GitHub, etc.), identifying pain points, and prototyping improved workflows, we aim to reduce friction and enable scalable growth for the community.

## Key Outcomes
- An inventory of existing tools and workflows.
- A documented list of common pain points and needs from the community.
- A prototype of an improved tool stack or workflow to address these needs.
- Clear documentation and guides to help contributors use our tools effectively.
