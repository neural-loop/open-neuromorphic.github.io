The "Student Talks" initiative provides a regular forum for academic discussions and presentations on neuromorphic computing. These talks are a core part of ONM's mission, offering a platform for students and early-career researchers to share their work with a global audience. The sessions are delivered virtually and focus on algorithmic and hardware topics in SNNs, with the potential for interactive coding or design sessions in the future.

All talks must align with ONM's commitment to open and collaborative science and benefit the community.

## Goals

Many ONM members and students are doing incredible work, and this series is designed to help them share it. If you have conducted research that you believe is applicable to a variety of problems, we encourage you to present it here. This not only increases the visibility of your work but also helps other ONM members adopt new methodologies, accelerating the advancement of neuromorphic science and technology.

1.  **Maximize Impact:** The primary aim is to benefit the ONM community. As our members are located worldwide, we ask speakers to be considerate of time zones to maximize attendance.
2.  **Focus on Education:** These talks are for learning and dissemination. While you can present work shared at conferences, the focus should be on teaching the community, not just practicing a talk.
3.  **Deliver Excellence:** Treat this as an opportunity to teach a class. We encourage you to be the best speaker version of yourself and make it a killer presentation!

## How It Works

Talks are generally scheduled every three weeks, with the exact timing announced in the `#student-talks` Discord channel and on the [main Student Talks page](/neuromorphic-computing/student-talks/).

A typical session lasts about 1 hour and 15 minutes, with approximately one hour for the presentation and 15 minutes for discussion.

1.  **Propose a Talk:** If you are interested in presenting, please follow the instructions on our [**Host an Event**](/getting-involved/share-your-work/) page. The best way to start is by posting your proposal in the `#student-talks` channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/hUygPUdD8E). Please include a brief summary or a one-page PDF of your talk to give the community a clear idea of the topic.
2.  **Scheduling:** An initiative lead will work with you to schedule a time that accommodates both you and a maximum number of community members. The final date and time will be announced at least one week in advance.
3.  **The Event:** A link to the virtual event (typically on YouTube Live) will be shared on the day of the talk. The presentation portion is usually recorded for those who cannot attend live. The Q&A and discussion phase may or may not be recorded, at the speaker's discretion.
4.  **Post-Event:** The recorded talk can be hosted on ONMâ€™s YouTube channel or provided to you privately. Further questions and discussions can continue asynchronously in the `#student-talks` Discord channel.

## Notes

-   In case of any miscommunications or technical issues, the `#student-talks` Discord channel will have the latest information.
-   The "Student Talks" initiative is dynamic. The frequency, topics, and scheduling process may evolve based on community feedback and participation.
-   We always welcome volunteers to help host or chair these sessions. If you're interested, please let us know in the Discord channel!
