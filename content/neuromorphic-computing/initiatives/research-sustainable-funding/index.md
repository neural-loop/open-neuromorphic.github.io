## Objective
To ensure the long-term health and growth of Open Neuromorphic, this initiative will investigate and recommend sustainable, transparent funding mechanisms. While ONM operates on a volunteer basis, stable funding is necessary to support core infrastructure and new community-driven projects.

## Key Outcomes
- A research summary of fiscal sponsorship and donation options suitable for ONM.
- A drafted operational budget outlining ONM’s core needs.
- A sponsorship prospectus document to present to potential partners and sponsors.
