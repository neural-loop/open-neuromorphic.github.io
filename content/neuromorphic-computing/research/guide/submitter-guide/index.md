Welcome to the Open Neuromorphic Research (ONR) Initiative! This guide outlines how to submit your work for review and inclusion in our Community Peer Review Program. Submissions are accepted on a rolling basis.

## What Can You Submit?

We welcome open-source neuromorphic projects of all kinds, including but not limited to:

-   **Research Codebases:** SNN models, simulators, benchmarks.
-   **Datasets:** Including dataset preparation pipelines.
-   **Educational Tools:** Tutorials and comprehensive documentation.
-   **Hardware Support:** Libraries, FPGA/ASIC interfaces.
-   **Analysis & Visualization:** Tools and measurement utilities.

Submissions may take the form of Git repositories, Jupyter notebooks, IEEE-formatted papers (PDF), or technical whitepapers. Your project must satisfy the [Open Neuromorphic Definition of Open](/about/governance/open-definition/).

We especially encourage well-documented Jupyter notebooks that walk through core functionality and demonstrate reproducibility. Please try to submit source files for figures where possible.

## How to Submit

1.  **Prepare Your Project:** Ensure your repository or paper includes:
    -   A `README.md` with a project overview and instructions.
    -   A license file (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, CC-BY-SA 4.0).
    -   Reproducible setup instructions (`requirements.txt`, `environment.yml`, Dockerfile).
    -   For notebooks: Clear annotations and runnable cells.
    -   For PDFs: Title, authors, abstract, and references.

2.  **Complete the Submission Form:** Submit your project using the official ONR submission form:

3.  **Await Assignment:** Your submission will be reviewed by a panel of 3–5 ONM volunteer reviewers. You’ll receive confirmation and an estimated timeline.

## Review Criteria

Projects are evaluated based on our official [Review Criteria](/neuromorphic-computing/research/review-criteria/), which prioritizes openness, impact, clarity, and reproducibility.

## Outcomes

We expect to provide decisions within one month of submission.

-   **If approved**, your project will receive an "ONM Community Approved" badge and will be featured in the ONR program registry.
-   **If not yet approved**, you’ll receive actionable feedback and may revise and resubmit.
