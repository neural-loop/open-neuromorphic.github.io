### The "ONM Community Approved" Badge

The "ONM Community Approved" badge is a mark of quality and trust within the neuromorphic ecosystem. It signifies that a project, paper, or resource has successfully passed the Open Neuromorphic Research (ONR) community peer-review process.

### What the Badge Represents

When you see this badge, it means the work has been evaluated against our [official review criteria](/neuromorphic-computing/research/review-criteria/) and has been recognized for its:

-   **Clarity:** The work is well-documented and easy to understand.
-   **Reproducibility:** The results can be independently verified by the community.
-   **Impact:** The contribution is valuable and relevant to the neuromorphic field.
-   **Openness:** The work adheres to open-source principles with permissive licensing.

### How to Display the Badge

Once your submission is approved, you are encouraged to display the badge prominently in your project's `README.md` file on GitHub or on your project's website.
