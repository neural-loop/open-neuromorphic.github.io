Open Neuromorphic is built on a foundation of open collaboration. We are proud to partner with a growing network of open-source projects, academic labs, and organizations that share our vision for a more accessible, reproducible, and competitive neuromorphic ecosystem.

## The Collaboration Network

We believe that by working together and promoting each other's work, we can elevate the entire field. Our open-source partners help us by linking back to Open Neuromorphic from their project websites, GitHub repositories, or documentation.

This simple act of cross-promotion helps build domain authority and brings more visibility to everyone in the network, creating a virtuous cycle of discovery and growth. In return, we are proud to feature them here and across our platform.

{{< details summary="How to Link to Us" open="true" >}}

You can support our community by linking back to us. Here are examples you can use in your project website, `README.md`, and generated documentation sites.

### Text Link

A simple text link is a great way to show support. We recommend linking to our main "Neuromorphic Computing" hub.

```
Part of the <a href="https://open-neuromorphic.org/neuromorphic-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Neuromorphic</a> community.
```
or
```
Part of the [Open Neuromorphic](https://open-neuromorphic.org/neuromorphic-computing/) community.
```

**Result:** Part of the [Open Neuromorphic](https://open-neuromorphic.org/neuromorphic-computing/) community.

### Community Badge

You can also use a badge. Here is a generic community badge you can use.

```
[![Open Neuromorphic Community](https://img.shields.io/badge/community-Open%20Neuromorphic-667eea?style=for-the-badge)](https://open-neuromorphic.org)
```

**Result:** <a href="https://open-neuromorphic.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/community-Open%20Neuromorphic-667eea?style=for-the-badge" alt="Open Neuromorphic Community"><svg class="icon icon-arrow-up-right-from-square inline-block  ml-[.5] pb-[.4]" fill="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" role="img" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle; width: 1em; height: 0.7em;">
