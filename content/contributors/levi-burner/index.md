Levi Burner is a postdoc with the Intelligent Sensing Laboratory (headed by Prof. Christopher Metzler) and the Perception and Robotics Group (jointly led by Prof. Yiannis Aloimonos and Dr. Cornelia Fermüller) at the University of Maryland, USA. Levi’s work considers representations of vision that are inspired by psychology and neuroscientific studies, which allow robots to perform tasks in easier ways, and without a calibration.
