# Supporters of Open Neuromorphic
# This file manages the list of open-source projects and future tiered supporters.
# `page_path` should link to the software/hardware page on this site.
# `logo` should be the filename of the logo within the corresponding page bundle.
# `dark_logo_invert = true` will apply a CSS invert filter in dark mode for logos that are dark.
